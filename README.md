## Quick start
Below is described how to get the **Superblocks Lab** _PreactJS_ project setup and running locally.

### Install node modules
Use `yarn` [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).
```sh
yarn install
```

### Run in development mode
```sh
yarn start
```

Browse to `http://localhost:3000`. Note that if you use any other hostname/IP than `localhost`, then instead run update 'ORIGIN' value in 'env.development', this is important so that the iframes can communicate with the main window.

### Make a production build
```sh
yarn build
```

The dist files will be inside `./dist`.

### Bumping version
Set the new version both in `app.js` and in `manifest.json`.

Run this script to fix that for you:

```sh
./bump_version "1.1.0"
```

Consider double-checking and updating the `CHANGELOG` to reflect the changes. Tag the new version.
